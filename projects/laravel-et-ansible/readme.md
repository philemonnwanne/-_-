# [Deploying](.com)-Laravel-with-Ansible


To avoid my project being totally dependent on `ansible` I made a few modifications of my own (by creating custom scripts). Also to avoid exposure of data and private info, I made sure to encrypt my credentials using `ansible-vault` which would require a password for one to decrpyt the contents of such files.
